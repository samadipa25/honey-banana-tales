Chia seeds have been quite the hype in the last few years and for all the right reasons. It is a nutrient loaded superfood loaded with antioxidants and high in fibre and protein. They also contain a decent amount of zinc, vitamin B3 (niacin), potassium, vitamin B1 (thiamine) and vitamin B2. Plus they are non-gmo and gluten free. This post is great resource for anyone looking for

* New ways to consume their daily protein powder rather than the same boring protein shake everyday.
* Healthy dessert recipes.
* Gluten free and vegan tasty breakfast// snack options.

Apart from all the awesome health benefits, they can be used to make tasty and easy recipes which whip up in less than 10 minutes of work. I will first cover the more traditional chia pudding recipe and also show how rice cracker/ cake topped with the chocolate pudding can make up for a tasty and healthy substitute to a nutella toast.

The pudding also lasts in the fridge for 4-5 days and can be meal prepped ahead of time.

### Instructions

**When using cacao powder and maple syrup/ honey/ agave**

1. In a bowl, whisk together the cacao, maple syrup/ honey / agave, crushed dates, ground cinnamon, salt and vanilla. Then add the milk little at a time until it forms a smooth paste, then add the remaining milk to form a smooth consistency.

**When using chocolate protein powder**

1. In a blender or mixer, blend together the milk, dates, protein powder, ground cinnamon, salt and vanilla. You can also add a tiny amount of raw honey/ maple syrup as per your personal sweetness preference.

**Remaining instructions**

1. Add chia seeds and whisk to combine. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes and whisk once again to combine thoroughly. Then refrigerate for at least 2 hours in the fridge or better overnight.
2. Serve chilled with desired toppings like fruits, coconut shreds, nuts. I have used a topping of pineapple, blueberry and strawberry. Store the leftovers in an airtight container for 4-5 days.

**Chocolate chia toast for breakfast/ snack**

**Ingredients**

* Fruits, nuts, toppings of choice

**Instructions**

1. Use plain rice cracker/ cake or any other plain gluten free cracker. Even whole grain bread can be used but I personally prefer rice cracker as it is more crispy and also gluten free.
2. Top it with the leftover chia pudding from your fridge.
3. Slice a few strawberries or any other fruit of your choice. You can also add crushed or slivered nuts for the healthy fats. And enjoy the toast alongside a healthy serving of fruit.

And that is a tasty nutritious breakfast ready in literally minutes. I am really addicted to this. This satisfies my all time sweet craving and is also super nutritious.
