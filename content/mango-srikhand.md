If you love desserts but at the same time want something healthy and easy to make, this dish is sure to please you. Made from yogurt, honey and mangoes, this mango srikhand is high in vitamin C, probiotics and has high antioxidant and anti-microbial properties due to the honey. 

This dish also whips up pretty quickly if you have already prepped the yogurt to drain out most of its water. 

This recipe makes around 5-6 servings.

#### Ingredients

1. 2 lbs plain yogurt/ greek yogurt
2. 2 cups chopped mangoes pureed inside a food processor/ blender/ 1 1/2 canned pureed mango
3. 1/3 to 1/2 cup honey depending on sweetness of mangoes
4. 1 tsp cardamom powder
5. Few chopped up mango cubes (for garnish)
6. Slivered almonds (for garnish)

#### Instructions

1. Line a big bowl with cheese cloth and pour the yogurt into it.
2. Gather the corners of the cloth and tie it into a bundle. Hang the cheese cloth for 2-3 hours so that all the water drains out and the consistency becomes thicker than greek yogurt. If you are not using greek yogurt, you might need to hang for 5-6 hours for all the water to drain out completely.
3. Once all the water is drained out, pour the thickened yogurt into a big bowl and whisk thoroughly to remove any clumps.
4. Stir in the honey, pureed mangoes and cardamom and whisk well. You can also use a electric hand mixer or blender so that everything is blended together well.
5. Pour equal amounts of the yogurt mixture into 6 serving bowls and top it with few mango cube and slivered almonds.
