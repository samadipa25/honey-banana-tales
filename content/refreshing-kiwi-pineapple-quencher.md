Smoothies are the craze of this generation and for all the right reasons. They are super healthy and delicious at the same time. Here I share one of my favorite smoothies on a hot summer day which shall keep you hydrated and make you feel super refreshed. This smoothie made from kiwi, pineapple and spinach packs all the vitamins and minerals and is so tasty. Kiwi provides the perfect boost of vitamin C and I can never stop raving about pineapple - it has the enzyme bromelain which is highly anti-inflammatory and also helps to restore the gut and aids in digestion.

Made from only a few ingredients, this smoothie is super simple to make and can save you big bucks at a smoothie shop. The following recipe serves 2.

#### Ingredients

* 2 kiwis
* 2 cups of frozen pineapple chunks
* 1.5 cups fresh spinach
* 1/2 cup coconut water/ ice
* 2 tsp jaljeera powder (_optional_)
