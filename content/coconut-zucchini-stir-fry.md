Every other recipe that I have looked online for zucchini involves cheese. Although I really love cheese, but sometimes I just want to keep my dinner light but at the same time tasty. This coconut stir fry recipe is really low on calories and is great for my vegan friends as this recipe is completely vegan. Also with just a few ingredients, this dish is ready in less than 10 minutes. 

This recipe serves 2-3.

#### Ingredients

* 2 large zucchinis cut moon shaped.
* 3/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut.
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp dried basil leaves
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* sesame seeds (for garnish)
* cilantro (for garnish)
