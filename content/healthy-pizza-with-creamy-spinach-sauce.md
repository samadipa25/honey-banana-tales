Although I would not say that I am a fan of pizza, but I do like having this treat from time to time. But the thought of highly processed flour along with preservative loaded sauces makes me stay away from it at the restaurants. So here is a perfectly healthy recipe for everyone's favorite meal. The crust being made from whole grain flour and the pizza sauce made from scratch using spinach, parmesan and greek yogurt, this pizza is a tasty alternative for your regular curry and roti. The below recipe makes 4 6" pizzas

#### Ingredients

##### For Crust

* 2 cups Ashirvaad multigrain whole wheat flour/ any whole grain flour of your choice
* 2 tsp yeast
* 1.5 tsp salt

##### Pizza sauce

* 9 oz/250 gm pack of spinach
* 2 tbsp olive oil/ oil of choice
* 2/3rd cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 1/4 cup of sour cream

##### Other ingredients

* 2 cup Mozzarella
* 1/2 burrata cheese ball (optional)
* 1 Jalapeno

#### Instructions

* Detailed instructions for the pizza sauce can be found on this post - [https://honeybananatales.com/creamy-spinach-dip/](https://honeybananatales.com/creamy-spinach-dip/ "Creamy Spinach dip")
* For the pizza crust, I used my rotimatic to provide me with 4 6" pizza crusts and then rested the crusts in the fridge for 2 hours
* Preheat the oven to 490 degree celcius
* Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil/ parchment paper and place the pizza crusts on it. Lightly brush each side of the pizza crust with avocado oil/ olive oil. 
* Layer each pizza crust with first the pizza sauce, then the mozarella cheese and then the rest of the toppings. Finally sprinkle it with the seasonings. 
* Once ready, place the baking sheet into the preheated oven for 7 minutes.
* If using burrata cheese (optional), chop the cheese ball into small cubes. Take out the baking sheet after 4 minutes and add in the burrata cheese cubes onto the pizzas and then bake for another 3 minutes

  I had also made the same pizza with store bought creamy tomato basil sauce but I liked the homemade sauce more.
