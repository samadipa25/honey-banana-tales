Are you also in the lookout for healthy dips like me, without compromising on the taste? Well then this might be your perfect answer. I have used this dip with whole grain chips and also as a pizza base! And every time it tastes so great. Spinach is also loaded with healthy nutrients like vitamin K, magnesium, iron and vitamin B12 and also helps maintain bone health.

This recipe makes 1.5 cups of dip.

#### Ingredients

* 9 oz/250 gm pack of spinach
* 2 tbsp olive oil/ oil of choice
* 2/3rd cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 1/4 cup of sour cream

#### Instructions

* Heat 2 tbsp of oil on a deep pan. Once the oil is hot, add in the spinach
* Cook the spinach on medium flame till water separates from the spinach and it has completely wilted down
* Pass the spinach into a cheese cloth and drain away excess water
* In a food processor, add in the cooked spinach, sour cream, greek yogurt and garlic and process on medium high speed
* Pour the mixture onto a serving bowl and add in the grated parmesan cheese and mix thoroughly
