I totally love pancakes for breakfast. They are healthy, tasty and so easy to make. They are so easy to store and freeze that they also make for a great make ahead breakfast. These pancakes today are very high in protein from the eggs and protein powder used and contain healthy fats from coconut oil and coconut milk. Although I have used semolina (sooji) for this recipe along with coconut flour but this recipe can be easily made gluten free by using almond flour instead of semolina.

Sugar has been substituted with stevia and honey. I don't like the aftertaste of stevia myself. But I have noticed when stevia is used with honey/ maple, the bitter aftertaste is gone and the sweetness is actually enhanced at a cost of substantially few calories. Also I cannot highlight enough the health benefits of raw unfiltered honey. It is very high in antioxidants and has excellent antimicrobial properties.

The recipe here makes 12-15 small sized pancakes.
