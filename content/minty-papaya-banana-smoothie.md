I have always absolutely loved the taste of papayas. I can anytime eat it in a fruit salad or in a smoothie. It is also loaded with nutrients and helps digestion in the gut. This smoothie containing papaya, mint and kefir is your perfect savior when your tummy is upset after eating the cheat meal. The following recipe serves 2.
