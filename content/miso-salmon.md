Salmon is one of my all time dinner time favorites. And why not? It is so tasty and packed with health benefits and at the same time so easy to prepare. 

Salmon is very high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids and loaded with essential minerals like selenium, potassium, etc. But while choosing the right salmon type to enjoy the health benefits, it is important to remember that most of the commercially raised salmon contain high amounts of mercury which can have detrimental effects on our body. That is why, I usually go for wild varieties like sockeye, coho and king Salmon. 

Here I am making this super easy sweet and savory dish of miso salmon that you and your family shall definitely savor!

#### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp while/ red miso paste
* 1 tbsp soy / tamari (gluten free) sauce
* 1 tbsp sake/ wine vinegar
* 1 tbsp honey
* 2 tsp sesame oil/ vegetable oil 
* sesame seeds (for garnish)
* green onion (for garnish)

* Place the fish skin down on the parchment/ foil lined baking sheet and put in an oven preheated to 425 degree fahrenheit for 6-9 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillet.
* After that, broil the fish at 525 degree fahrenheit for 2-3 minutes until you have a slightly charred look on the top.
