Tired of eating the same oatmeal for breakfast everyday? We have got your covered. The banana bread recipe here is made primarily from rolled oats so that you can enjoy the benefits of having oatmeal, ie ., improve blood sugar, lowers cholesterol and are rich in antioxidant.

This banana bread contains no sugar or butter and is made only from wholesome ingredients. It is also high in protein and can also be made completely gluten free.

#### Instructions

* Preheat oven to 350 degree fahrenheit/ 180 degree celcius.
* Whisk the eggs and mash the bananas and mix them together. Add in the yogurt/ buttermilk and honey and mix well.
* Mix all the dry ingredients together and stir it into the wet mixture little by little to form a semi thick batter.
* Stir in 2/3rd of the chocolate chips.
* Pour the batter into a parchment paper lined bread baking tray. Top it with the slivered almonds and rest of the chocolate chips.
* Bake it in the oven for 40-50 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.
* Once baked, take the bread out of the oven and let it rest for an hour before slicing it.

The gluten free banana bread turned out to be very moist and fluffy that I could not resist taking a bite into it soon after.
