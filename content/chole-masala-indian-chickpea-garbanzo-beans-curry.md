This Diwali ( Indian festival of lights), I was looking for a recipe for the Diwali potluck that could serve around 9-10 people. I wanted to have a recipe which can be made in a big batch without the effort required shooting up exponentially with the increase in quantity. Then I realized what could better serve my purpose other than my all favorite chole masala which is also completely vegan.

This recipe serves around 9 people.

##### If using dry chickpeas, follow steps 1 and 2 else follow from step 3

 1. Soak 3 cups of dry chickpeas with enough water overnight. You should have around 8 cups in the morning.
 2. In a pressure cooker, add the soaked chickpeas and around 8 cups of water, salt, cinnamon stick and bay leaf and pressure cook at high flame for 2 whistles. After that reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 10-15 minutes.

 3. In a wok, heat 3 tsp of oil. Once oil is hot, add 1 bayleaf, 2 star anise, black peppercorns and the cardomoms and saute for 1 minute.
 4. Add the onions, and fry for 5 minutes until the onion is translucent. Then add in the sliced garlic and minced ginger and saute for 1-2 minutes. 
 5. Next add all the spices and saute for another 1-2 minutes
 6. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 10-15 minutes on medium heat with lid on until the rawness of tomatoes are gone.
 7. Add the coconut milk and let it come to a boil.
 8. Now add the pressure cooked chickpeas or the canned chickpeas along with the water in the pressure cooker or can to the wok and reduce heat to medium low. Cover the pan and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes.
 9. You can add slightly more water if you like a thinner gravy but I did not add any more water as I like my gravy thick.
10. Garnish it with some ginger jullienes and serve hot along side some rice or roti (Indian bread).
