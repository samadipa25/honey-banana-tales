Who doesn't love desserts? But we often shy away from the high calories that desserts usually have. Apart from the high calories, most store made desserts have high amounts of sugar and refined flour, both of which are extremely harmful for the body causing joint pain and digestive issues. So here is this super delicious recipe which is high in protein. Made from coconut flour and semolina, it does contain carbs. But these are healthy carbs, and common, we all need some healthy carbs for energy and our body to function well :') 

Sugar has been substituted with stevia and honey. I don't like the aftertaste of stevia myself. But I have noticed when stevia is used with honey/ maple, the bitter aftertaste is gone and the sweetness is actually enhanced at a cost of substantially few calories.
