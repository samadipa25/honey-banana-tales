Who doesn't love desserts? But we often shy away from the high calories that desserts usually have. Apart from the high calories, most store made desserts have high amounts of sugar and refined flour, both of which are extremely harmful for the body causing joint pain and digestive issues. So here is this super delicious recipe which is high in protein. Made from coconut flour and semolina, it does contain carbs. But these are healthy carbs, and common, we all need some healthy carbs for energy and our body to function well :')

Sugar has been substituted with stevia and honey. I don't like the aftertaste of stevia myself. But I have noticed when stevia is used with honey/ maple, the bitter aftertaste is gone and the sweetness is actually enhanced at a cost of substantially few calories. Also I cannot highlight enough the health benefits of raw unfiltered honey. It is very high in antioxidants and has excellent antimicrobial properties.

The recipe here serves 3-4.

#### Ingredients for frosting

* 1 1/2 tbsp coconut oil

#### Instructions for the coconut lime cake

* Preheat oven to 350 degree fahrenheit.
* Beat the eggs well and add in all the wet ingredients and mix thoroughly.
* In a separate bowl, mix together all the dry ingredients.
* Stir in the dry mixture little by little into the wet mixture bowl and mix well.
* Pour the mixture into an small oven safe baking dish lined with parchment paper and bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.

After taking the cake out of the oven and while the cake is hot, poke holes all over the cake with a fork carefully. Pour in half of the frosting and let the cake sit for 1-2 hours.

After that, coat with rest of the frosting and garnish with fresh lime zest and raspberries or any other fruit of choice and enjoy!!
