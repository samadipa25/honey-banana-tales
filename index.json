But we often get intimidated by the amount of butter/oil and sugar and with that, hell lot of calories that these store bought treats have that we would rather skip. This brownie made with wholesome ingredients like avocado and honey is sure to be a crowd pleaser as well as satisfy anyone who is looking for options of healthy treats. So without much ado, let me jump straight to the recipe.\nIngredients   ½ cup mashed banana/ applesauce.\n  1 large avocado\n  ½ cup honey + ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder or ⅓ cup honey + ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder + ⅓ cup chocolate protein powder with stevia\n  2 large eggs\n  1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)\n  1 teaspoon baking soda\n  ¼ teaspoon salt\n  ⅓ cup semi-sweet/ ordinary chocolate chips (garnish on top)\n  ⅓ cup chopped walnut/ almond (garnish on top)\n  ½ cup coconut flour/ ½ cup almond flour\n[Download File]( \u0026ldquo;Download File\u0026rdquo;)  Instructions  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F/ 180 degrees celsius In a blender or food processor, blend together the eggs, avocado, banana and honey + cocoa or honey + cocoa + protein powder. I used honey + cocoa + protein powder in this recipe. In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients together and add it to the wet mixture in the blender and blend at a low speed setting. Adding vanilla is optional but highly recommended to mask the smell of avocado. Transfer the mixture to an oven safe baking dish and top with chopped nuts and chocolate chips. You can also add some in the mixture. Bake the brownie for 35 minutes or until set through After removing from the oven, cool the brownie on the counter top for 2 hours and then in the refrigerator for another 4 hours. Once the brownie is firm and set, cut it into 9 squares and enjoy.  ","permalink":"https://samadipa25.github.io/honey-banana-tales/first-featured/","tags":[],"title":"Healthy avocado fudge brownies"}]
